Here is a website.
https://higgsfield.ai/

Go to this website and the explore page (which is the main page), take inspiration from it - the card styling, the way it looks. Then you can go to the image generation page.
https://higgsfield.ai/image/nano_banana_2

Take inspiration for how it looks. You can take screenshots, you can scroll down on the explore page, understand what it looks like. Save those images as references.


Then you can navigate to this repository.
https://github.com/JimmyLv/awesome-nano-banana.git

This has about 100 cases, so you can take all the images and all the prompts as a guideline as the engine for each category that this AI agent is going to offer.

We are creating an AI agent which would make images using Nano Banana and OpenAI. In the repository, you will find prompts and different styles that could be used.

So use those images as card images so that you display all those images and those styles and an ability to create those images.

This is a comprehensive image generation system which has hundreds of different styles that could be generated. We can upload images as references, and it will use that to create a full experience.

You can also navigate to OpenAI Image Generation (the latest model documentation) and the Nano Banana Pro (the latest model documentation) and take references from there as well.

## 1. Purpose of This Document

This Markdown file is the **primary execution context** for building a fully-featured AI image generation application.

An AI agent or developer should be able to:
- Read this file
- Understand the **product vision**
- Implement the **frontend, backend, storage, and AI integrations**
- Deploy the application on **Vercel**
- Use **Vercel Blob** for all generated assets

This document serves as:
- Product Requirements Document (PRD)
- UI/UX reference
- Technical architecture plan
- Prompt & style engine definition

---

## 2. High-Level Product Vision

We are building a **premium AI image generation web application** inspired by **Higgsfield.ai**, powered by:
- **Nano Banana (Base + Pro)**
- **OpenAI’s latest Image Generation models**

The system supports:
- Hundreds of predefined visual styles
- Text-to-Image and Image-to-Image generation
- Reference image uploads
- Project-based workflows
- Persistent cloud storage
- Modern, card-based exploration UI

This is not a single-prompt tool — it is a **complete image generation ecosystem**.

---

## 3. Core Inspirations & References

### 3.1 UI & UX Inspiration — Higgsfield.ai

Primary visual inspiration:
- https://higgsfield.ai/
- https://higgsfield.ai/image/nano_banana_2

Key UI principles to extract:
- Card-based exploration grid
- Clean, premium, minimal design
- Strong visual hierarchy
- Subtle gradients, shadows, rounded corners
- Clear separation between *Explore* and *Generate*

The Explore page is the **entry point** of the app.
The Image Generation page is the **core interaction surface**.

Screenshots from these pages should be saved internally as **design references**.

---

### 3.2 Prompt & Style Engine — awesome-nano-banana

Repository:
- https://github.com/JimmyLv/awesome-nano-banana

This repository contains ~100 curated **prompt cases**, each demonstrating:
- A visual style
- A creative technique
- A specific rendering approach

These cases form the **foundation of the app’s style library**.

Each case must be converted into:
- A UI card
- A reusable prompt template
- A selectable generation style

---

### 3.3 Model References

Supported generation engines:
- **Nano Banana (Base)**
- **Nano Banana Pro (High-quality / 4K)**
- **OpenAI Image Generation (latest model)**

The system must be model-agnostic and extensible.

---

## 4. Application Structure

### 4.1 Main Sections

1. **Explore**
2. **Generate**
3. **Upload / Reference**
4. **Gallery (Saved Projects)**

---

## 5. UI / UX Specification

### 5.1 Explore Page

Purpose:
- Discovery
- Inspiration
- Style selection

Layout:
- Header (Logo + Navigation)
- Hero search bar
- Filter controls (categories, tags)
- Card grid (lazy loaded)

Each **Style Card** includes:
- Preview image
- Style name
- Short description
- Model compatibility badges
- CTA: “Generate with this style”

The visual language should closely resemble **Higgsfield’s card design**.

---

### 5.2 Image Generation Page

Purpose:
- Core creation workflow

Sections:

#### Input Panel
- Prompt textarea
- Reference image upload (optional)
- Model selector:
  - Nano Banana
  - Nano Banana Pro
  - OpenAI Image
- Style selector (from library)

#### Advanced Controls
- Resolution (1K / 2K / 4K)
- Aspect ratio
- Seed (optional)
- Style intensity

#### Output Panel
- Loading / progress state
- Generated image variants
- Actions:
  - Download
  - Save to project
  - Regenerate

---

### 5.3 Gallery / Projects Page

Purpose:
- Persistence
- Reuse
- Iteration

Features:
- Saved generations
- Grouped by project
- Metadata display (prompt, model, date)
- Re-generate from history

---

## 6. Prompt & Style Library System

### 6.1 Source of Truth

All styles originate from:
- awesome-nano-banana repository cases

Each case becomes a **Style Object**.

### 6.2 Style Object Schema

```json
{
  "id": "string",
  "name": "string",
  "category": "string",
  "promptTemplate": "string",
  "exampleImages": ["url"],
  "tags": ["string"],
  "recommendedModel": "nano-banana | nano-banana-pro | openai"
}
6.3 Categories (Examples)
Characters & Avatars

Product Visualization

Architecture

Concept Art

Ads & Posters

Experimental / Abstract

Photography Simulation

3D & CGI

7. Backend Architecture
7.1 Tech Stack
Layer	Technology
Frontend	Next.js (React)
Styling	Tailwind CSS
Backend	Next.js API Routes
Storage	Vercel Blob
Auth (optional)	NextAuth

text
Copy code
POST   /api/generate
POST   /api/upload
GET    /api/styles
GET    /api/projects
GET    /api/project/:id
7.3 Image Generation Flow
User selects style + prompt

Optional reference images uploaded

Backend prepares final prompt

Request sent to selected model

Result images stored in Vercel Blob

Metadata saved to project record

URLs returned to frontend

8. Storage & Data Management
8.1 Vercel Blob Usage
All images must be stored in Vercel Blob:

Generated outputs

Uploaded references

Style previews

8.2 Project Data Schema
json
Copy code
{
  "projectId": "string",
  "userId": "string",
  "items": [
    {
      "imageUrl": "string",
      "prompt": "string",
      "model": "string",
      "styleId": "string",
      "createdAt": "timestamp"
    }
  ]
}
9. Model Integration Strategy
9.1 Nano Banana
Fast, cost-efficient

Default for most styles

9.2 Nano Banana Pro
High-fidelity

Supports native 4K

Used for premium styles

9.3 OpenAI Image Generation

Model switching reliability

Blob storage limits

Regeneration consistency

12. Future Enhancements

Credit-based usage system

Batch generation

Prompt auto-improvement AI

Style marketplace

Animation & video generation extensions

13. Final Notes
This document is intentionally comprehensive.

Any AI agent or developer reading this file should:

Treat it as the single source of truth

Implement features exactly as defined

Preserve design inspiration while avoiding direct copying

Build the system in a modular, extensible way
